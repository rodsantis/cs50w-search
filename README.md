# Google's search website

## The project-0 of CS50W

The goal here was to replicate the pages of **Google Search**, **Google Image Search** and **Google Advanced Search**.

My project as per the course specification should be to anylize and understand the parameters which the google search page and URLs were using so to submit
my form to the same parameters and get the user of my page redericted to the page of their search.

My Project should resemble Google's style of CSS and layout so my links, buttons and search bar should be placed on the same location.

The Advanced Search should contain only the first 4 (four) fields of input: “all these words:”, “this exact word or phrase:”, “any of these words:” and
“none of these words:” as per the course project owns specification.

The Image search would bring you as expected to the image result from Google also, and the "I'm feeling lucky" button will bring you also to the first page
of the results found for your search.
You may encounter a redirect notice when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Not to worry! This is an expected consequence of a security feature
implemented by Google.

This was a project for me to work with HTML and CSS.
